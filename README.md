The data flow in the Todo List application follows this pattern:

1-The App component maintains the state for the list of todos using the useState hook.
2-It defines functions (addTodo and removeTodo) to manipulate the todo list.
3-The App component renders the TodoList and TodoForm components.
4-The TodoList component receives the todos array and the removeTodo function as props.
5-The TodoList component maps over the todos array to render individual TodoItem components.
6-Each TodoItem component receives a single todo item and the removeTodo function as props.
7-The TodoForm component receives the addTodo function as a prop.
8-When a new todo is added or removed, the state is updated in the App component, and the changes propagate down to child components via props.
