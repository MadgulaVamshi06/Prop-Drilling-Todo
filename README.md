The data flow in the Todo List application follows this pattern:

The App component maintains the state for the list of todos using the useState hook.

It defines functions (addTodo and removeTodo) to manipulate the todo list.

The App component renders the TodoList and TodoForm components.

The TodoList component receives the todos array and the removeTodo function as props.

The TodoList component maps over the todos array to render individual TodoItem components.

Each TodoItem component receives a single todo item and the removeTodo function as props.

The TodoForm component receives the addTodo function as a prop.

When a new todo is added or removed, the state is updated in the App component, and the changes propagate down to child components via props.
